Basic Gauss-Seidel iteration code gsit [sounds: jeezit].
2020-07-02:
-Lambetian surface (tried numba yesterday, but it did not work well: no accelration, the code must be rebuilt)
2020-06-29:
-azimuth dependence added and tested vs IPOL for R&A.
2020-06-18:
-gsit now computes SS(of azimuth) + MS(azimutally averaged). Tested as usual.
2020-06-14 (B):
-integration of the source function - down; tested vs IPOL fro R & A
2020-06-14 (A):
-integration of the source function - upward; tested vs IPOL fro R & A
2020-06-12:
-symmetry of the gauss-scattering matrix is added; code clenned and comemnted a bit better
2020-06-07:
-tested vs IPOL for aerosol; errors fixed
2020-06-05:
-first uploaded, tested vs IPOL for a simple Rayleigh case.
